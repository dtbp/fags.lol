          Hi there my name is aj, i have had many past names. u may have heard of me by the names of rau, ray, 
          + may more but wont disclose cuz of my past com moments looking back i was a disgrace and will never look back there.
          but furthermore i will like to disclose why i am quiting not fully but most things.
          i feel like this is a good time to disclose this because discord is just not a place for me my mental health is at my lowest,
          as well as the people on it they are disgraceful and should really be in a bording school as such, 
          some people may see me as a hero, or possible your average larp but only one of those is correct.
          of course its me being a larp, lol u thought im not a larp but im not a hero, to see how far i have come i have realised what im serving for
        im serving my country to give these desgraceful kids a chance of having a life me being in the army i regret serving for the kids i do serve for,
          but not just the children some adults too, i grew up with a good childhood i was never around discord or any socials, until i got my pc, thats when it started
        it started its journey there and then after that went to dark places which i keep classified due to certain things, but i cant be arsed to type any more as of right now
        so this page will be continued so i mean come back in about 2-3 days and it should be updated to its max capacity. if you dont wanna read dont read it that just
        proves to me what a friend you were to me so goodbye for now.

          -take care
        your dearest,
          aj.

          a bit of an inspirational quote from a rapper i like.
          
          If we wan the world to continue to build
          We have to respect the come up
          Look at how far you've come
          Respect the journey, man
          Count the blessings, accept the changes
          Appreciate the highs and the lows
          For the good and the bad all make us who we are today
          There is no ups without downs
          To struggle without you respect your own journey
          Respect when you see someone who comes from nothin'
          And turns it into somethin'
          Now that's everythin'
